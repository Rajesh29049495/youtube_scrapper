Suppose, what we are doing here is all self learning but there must be a target decided by the stakeholders/clients. \nIf you are trying to predict a student's eligibility for a scholarship, the total marks might be more important than the average marks since scholarships may be based on total marks.\nIf the model indicates that the total marks are a strong predictor of a student's performance, it may be harder to understand how much the average marks contributed to that prediction if they are not considered separately.\nAlso, elimination of noise and variability in the data is a factor here!",

PDF is used to represent the probability density of a continuous random variable such as the weight of students in a classroom.\n2. PMF is used to represent the probability of a discrete random variable such as the number of students in a classroom.\n3. CDF is used to represent the cumulative probability of a random variable being less than or equal to a certain value, such as the probability that a student in a classroom weighs less than or equal to 60 kg.\n\nSection 3: Actionable Takeaways\n1. Watch the video to gain a deep understanding of PDF, PMF, and CDF.\n2. Familiarize yourself with examples of continuous and discrete random variables and understand which function to use in each case.\n3. Practice solving problems related to PDF, PMF, and CDF to gain confidence and mastery over the concepts.\n4.
